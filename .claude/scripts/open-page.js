/**
 * open-page.js
 *
 * Opens a generated HTML page in the user's default browser, on any platform.
 *
 * Replaces the bare `start "" "<path>"` the workflow commands used to run.
 * `start` is a cmd.exe builtin — it exists only on Windows, so on macOS and
 * Linux the dashboard, the two approval pages, and the build reports silently
 * failed to open, on the critical path of /start and /continue.
 *
 * Deterministic by design (CLAUDE.md: script only what must run identically
 * every time). Keeping the platform choice here rather than in each command's
 * prose also means the bash-permission-checker allowlist needs ONE entry instead
 * of a per-platform regex for start/open/xdg-open.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node .claude/scripts/open-page.js generated-docs/dashboard.html
 *   node .claude/scripts/open-page.js --print-only <path>   # resolve, don't open
 *
 * Relative paths resolve against the REPO ROOT, not the CWD — the bash tool's
 * CWD persists across calls and drifts into web/ (see lib/project-root.js).
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — page handed to the OS opener (or --print-only)
 *   1 — file not found, or no opener available; the path is printed so the user
 *       can open it manually rather than the workflow stalling on a blank screen.

/**
 * Opener argv for the current platform.
 *
 * win32: NO SHELL, and Unicode-safe. Each option here was checked against three
 * path shapes with a beacon page that reports back when the browser really
 * renders it — non-ASCII (`ünïcode-Ω/påge.html`), `%USERPROFILE% reports/`, and
 * `dir with space & amp/a & b.html`:
 *
 *            non-ASCII   %VAR%   &
 *   explorer    yes       yes    yes
 *   rundll32    NO        yes    yes     (resolves url.dll's ANSI entry point)
 *   cmd start   yes       NO     yes     (cmd expands %VAR% into another path)
 *
 * So `explorer` is primary. `cmd /c start` is gone: it also invited a subtler bug
 * — caret-escaping `&` yielded a literal `a ^& b.html`, because inside a quoted
 * string cmd treats `^` as an ordinary character, not an escape. Every cmd failure
 * looked the same from here: wrong path, modal "cannot find" dialog, hung call.
 *
 * rundll32 stays as the fallback for Windows installs with no `explorer.exe`
 * (Server Core, some containers), where an ASCII path is the likely case anyway.
 *
 * NOTE: `explorer.exe` exits 1 even on success, so on Windows a successful spawn
 * is the only signal available — see tryOpen. Do not "fix" that by testing
 * explorer's exit code; it would make every successful open look like a failure.
 *
 * linux: xdg-open first, then wslview, which is what works under WSL.

 * opened the page, so its exit code carries no information.
 *
 * Everywhere else the exit code is meaningful, and checking it is what makes the
 * fallback chain work at all: `xdg-open` is usually installed under WSL and on
 * headless boxes yet fails there, so treating a successful spawn as success would
 * make `wslview` — the opener that actually works under WSL — unreachable, and
