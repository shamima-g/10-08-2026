 * inject-phase-context.js
 *
 * Post-compaction hook: restores workflow instructions after auto-compaction.
 * Fires via SessionStart (matcher: "compact") in the orchestrator session.
 *
 * Reads per-epic state.json (resolved via resolve-state-path.js) and injects:
 *   Tier 1 - Workflow coordinates (always)
 *   Tier 2 - Orchestration rules (not in CLAUDE.md, lost on compaction)
 *   Tier 3 - Recency reinforcement (observed drift points)
 *   Phase-specific process steps from phase-context/*.md
 *
 * Output: JSON with hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext
 * Fail-safe: exits 0 with no output when not on an active epic branch.
 *
 * Port of inject-phase-context.ps1 — see lib/workflow-state.js for why.

## Orchestration Rules (post-compaction recovery)

### Phase Model
PLAN -> BUILD -> EPIC-END -> MANUAL-TEST -> COMPLETE-ON-BRANCH -> COMPLETE.
An epic may also be parked at READY-TO-BUILD (between PLAN and BUILD) when planned ahead via /plan; /start or /continue then builds it.
State authority lives in generated-docs/epics/<slug>/state.json on the active epic/* branch.
Project-level facts (roles, auth, data source, compliance, styling) live in generated-docs/project.md on main.

### Approvals
1. INTAKE approval -- end of INTAKE: approve project.md + epic plan (first project) or just the epic brief.md (a later epic).
2. Stories approval -- end of PLAN: approve the stories for this epic.
3. Manual-test approval -- end of MANUAL-TEST: approve before opening the PR.
4. User-approved merge -- end of COMPLETE-ON-BRANCH: orchestrator never auto-merges.
The workflow chains continuously between approvals.

### Agent Autonomy
The BUILD agent (developer) resolves standard decisions itself and halts only for categories in .claude/shared/agent-autonomy.md ("Always halt"): permission changes, API contract modifications, undocumented API usage (endpoint/param/header/body not in the OpenAPI spec — halt category undocumented-endpoint, which you surface via the four-option menu in continue.md §B3), new dependencies, state/data-fetching library swaps, auth flow changes, cross-cutting architecture, project.md contradictions, CLAUDE.md policy contradictions, missing Playwright spec for a routable story.

Halts that propose changes to project.md include requiresProjectChange: true; the orchestrator routes those through the .claude/policies/epic-branch-concurrency.md §6.1 project-change flow instead of surfacing to the user.

### User Approval Policy
Output proposed content as conversation text BEFORE calling AskUserQuestion. Never auto-approve on the user's behalf.`;

const QUALITY_REMINDERS = `
## Quality Reminders
- the orchestrator runs a light gate inline per story (--checks lint,test-quality); the developer already ran full Vitest + typecheck
- the full /quality-check suite (build, TypeScript, full Vitest, security) runs once at epic-end, inline (Step B7.0), then a /code-review --fix pass via the code-review-runner subagent (Step B7.0.5) — invoke the runner, do not run /code-review inline — before E2E and manual testing
- Playwright runs once at epic-end, last, against the production build the quality-check produced (Step B7.0.6), not per story`;
